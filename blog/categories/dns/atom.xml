    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My new Laptop from work, I recently started a new job at a company called Virtustream, was loaded with Ubuntu (Kubuntu I believe actually since its running KDE and I do not think that is the default with Ubuntu?) which was fine, I like the aptitude package manager, however I noticed that web pages loaded PAINFULLY SLOW. I tried anumber of things but when I saw that it was really new sites that I hadn&rsquo;t yet visited that were loading slowly I guessed DNS.</p>

<p>Upon googling Ubuntu 12.10 DNS I saw there were a number of people complaining. I decided to give it a try and set my /etc/resolv.conf to Google&rsquo;s DNS servers:</p>

<pre><code>nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
</code></pre>

<p>And now it runs like charm..</p>
