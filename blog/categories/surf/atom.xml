    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think there is a great opportunity to take advantage of all the great NOAA information out there provided by the government for free. With this I can use supervised learning with input from professionals and surfers using the site. I would gather professional input from the other surf forecasting sites out there and allow members to sign up and chart their own surf journals.</p>

<p>This would build surf journals for not just the popular spots like those you see on surfline but for anyspot a surfer desires. He could specify the closest booies and which area the secret spot was in and I would gather wind, tide, and swell information mostly to build a profile of the spot.</p>

<p>This blog post is actually being used as a landing page to gauge interest via a Google AdWords campaign. I will set this as the destination and hope people click through my ads. If so I know there are people interested in this idea as well.</p>
